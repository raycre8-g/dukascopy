# dukascopy - Dukascopy Bank SA historical data downloader

Finding good Forex data is difficult or expensive. Dukascopy has made available an excellent [web tool](https://www.dukascopy.com/swiss/english/marketwatch/historical/) to download tick data for a large a variety of 
Forex, CFD and commodities. This is awesome and extremely useful for people, like me, trying to study the Forex market. 
However, it takes a lot of time to download a large data set from the website because you can download only one day per time. In order to solve this issue, I created **dukascopy**.  

**dukascopy** is a small terminal application that can be used to download ticks for a given date range from the Dukascopy historical data feed for one or more symbols. **dukascopy** takes advantage of python threads and coroutine in order to speed up the download. It takes roughly 10m to download tick data for one year for a given instrument. 

Key features :
 - Ticks data with volumes
 - Candle formatting with different time-frames ( from 1 minute to 1 day )
 - CSV output
 - multi-thread support
 - Large variety of symbols

This is what **dukascopy** looks like:
